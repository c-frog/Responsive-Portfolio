            <p>Hello, my name is Clyde! I was born and raised in Boulder, CO, but have lived across the state. 
                As a photographer I travel around a lot for work, and wouldn't have it any other way. I hope to add 
                Web Developement to my resume so I can continue to travel and have a fulfilling personal life. 
                I mainly spend my free time backcountry skiing, hiking 14er's, and racing a J24 sailboat.
                <br><br>
                In a few years I hope to move to Whitefish MT, and grow my wedding photography business.
                After visiting many ski towns, I have found Whitefish to be the most compelling, 
                both for it's amazing mountain and surrounding lakes.
